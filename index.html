        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm David! I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia. I went to
          college at Georgia Southern University where I majored in Theatre
          Technologies. After graduation I moved to New York and worked
          Off-Broadway for a few years. Once Covid hit, I sat around in my
          apartment for a year and decided I wanted a change but wasn't sure
          exactly what. I took a year-long job out in Arizona to get back on my
          feet while I decided what my next step would be. Once that contract
          was over, I moved back to south Georgia and began a coding bootcamp
          online with the University of Minnesota. Pivoting my design skills and
          background from Theatre into web design has been one of the best
          decisions of my life and I look forward to the future that this new
          career will provide.
