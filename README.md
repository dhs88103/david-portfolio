## Description

My motivation to create this app was to create a portfolio of my work so far in the coding bootcamp.  The hope is that this portfolio will continue to grow with me as I make more and more applications through the course.  
I created an index.html from scratch to have a webpage that displays three sections: an about me, my work, and contact me.
I created a CSS sheet to style my HTML code so that it was visually appealing to the visitor and also included the functionality of adding external links to take visitors to the webpages I had worked on.
